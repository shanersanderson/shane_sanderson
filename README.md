Hi, I'm Shane. I was born in Connecticut but have lived a few different places. 
I'm taking this class for a couple of reasons:
a) I'm studying data journalism, so I need this class to graduate.
b) I loved CAR and I think data is a great source for story ideas.
c) I want to learn to build webscrapers.
